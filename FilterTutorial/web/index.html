						Audio filter that allows only certain high frequencies to pass through after a cut-off
						point. With a high-pass filter the lower frequencies will be cut off only allowing the upper ranges to pass.
						These filters are often used in audio mixing to roll off the low frequencies on more upper range
						instruments such as guitars, horns, and vocal to allow them to stand out in a mix and not bog down the
						more bass prominent regions of a song.

				</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Audio filter that only allows frequencies on the lower end of an audio wave to pass
					through. The higher frequencies will be cut off allowing for a more prominent bass sound to be heard.
					This is often used in mixing on bass drums, toms, and bass guitars to allow for the most rounded and
					large sound possible.

					<h3 class="panel-title">Band Pass</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Audio filter used to bypass both high and low frequencies only allowing for the midrange
					to pass. While high and low pass filters are used to give more bass and treble based
					instruments prominent in an audio mix, band-pass is used as more of a tool to make room
					for secondary instruments in the mix. This is done to avoid an overlap in frequencies
					so all instruments are heard at a audible level.
